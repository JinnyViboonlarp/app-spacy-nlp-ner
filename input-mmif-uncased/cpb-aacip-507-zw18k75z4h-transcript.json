              "@value": "good evening, and happy new year. today marks the first day for a lot of things, but in one industry in particular -- an industry that touches all our lives -- today is the beginning of a brave new world, the industry is banking, which is about to be revolutionized by a lifting of government regulations beginning today, making the business more competitive, blurring the distinctions between commercial banks and savings and loan associations. the changes are designed to benefit the consumer, but it may be a long time before the dust settles enough to make clear just who gains. many savings and loan people think that deregulation is rigged against them in favor of the big commercial banks. some fear the competition will wipe out many savings and loans and dry up money for house mortgages. what is clear is that a fierce battle for banking profit and survival lies ahead and that`s what we consider tonight -- the battle of the banks. jim?\n\nrobin, the specific changes that go into effect today are these. banks, all kinds -- savings and loans, mutual savings associations included -- can now offer checking accounts, and they can pay interest on the money in those accounts; that`s the so-called now account. the maximum interest an institution can pay today is 5 1/4 percent, but over the next six years that also is going to gradually change. under the guidance of a six-member deregulation board all interest ceilings on all accounts will be eliminated by 1986 and thus be subject to the open competitive market. also, the board has already eliminated the 1/4 percent more differential that savings and loans can pay for savings certificates; the differential on passbook savings may soon follow. to compensate for this, savings and loans can now enter the full consumer loan market, make car loans, issue credit cards, broaden their investments from home mortgages and do other things that in the past only commercial banks could do. all of these changes and more are contained in a new law called the depository institutions deregulation and monetary control act of 1980. it passed congress last march. it passed into practice today. robin?\n\nfor a view of what the new competitive world of banking may mean to consumers, we turn to marshall loeb, managing editor of money magazine. mr. loeb, how will the new laws benefit ordinary banks customers?\n\nthe new laws, robin, mean more competition and more choice; and as there is competition and choice, of course it will be helpful to people who are coming closer now to one-stop banking where you can go to one institution, get your mortgage, get your credit card, have your checking account which will draw interest, have your savings account as well. the other major factor is that those of us who have had checking accounts and have had our money in there drawing no money on it will now get interest upon those deposits if we choose.\n\ncould you describe one type of bank customer who will benefit most from the new competition?\n\nprobably that customer who has got a fairly large checking account because if your account drops below a certain so-called minimum balance, then you will have to pay either a fee or a charge per check or both. now. that minimum balance will vary bank by bank. in general it will be from $500 to $2,500, in some cases as much as $3,000. if you have a fairly large account, you will be drawing interest with no penalty on your checking deposits.\n\nthese now accounts have been in practice now in new jersey and new york for --\n\nand six new england states.\n\n-- and six new england states, for a couple of years. how have they worked out? i mean, are customers really benefiting from them?\n\nthose, of course, who have had their money in such accounts have indeed benefited. but at least they have had the choice. anybody who now can make that decision can determine for himself if his financial situation is such that it pays him to go into a now account. i would argue that it is much better to have that choice than not to have the choice.\n\nhow will raising, and six years later eliminating, the ceiling on interest that can be paid on savings accounts, how is that going to help people?\n\nwell, the -- that certainly will help people in that they will be getting more of a market rate or a competitive rate for their savings deposits. now, i would argue, there is discrimination. people, mostly small savers who have their money in savings banks, get federal limits on the amount of interest they may draw. those who have larger sums of money can put them in money market funds or other instruments that would pay much higher interest.\n\nso this brings the small saver up level with the personal?\n\nvery gradually it will bring the small saver up. indeed, now in savings institutions you get only 5la to 5l/z percent on your savings.\n\nwhat about negative effects? some people, as i said in the beginning, in savings and loan fear that mortgage money is going to dry up as a result of this, because they won`t do well and therefore the natural source of mortgage money won`t happen.\n\nthe savings and loan people are very worried that the elimination of the one-quarter-point differential -- which of course will not happen for five years -- will be very hurtful to them, and of course the savings and loan institutions are so important in mortgage finance. however, i think there is a strong case that what is hurting the mortgage market in this country is just the competition from all sorts of other instruments that pay much higher interest than savings and loan institutions now pay. just consider the enormous growth of money market funds, some of which pay 12 percent and now in a few instances even more. certainly they are drawing huge sums away from those institutions that would now pay only 5 1/2 percent.\n\nwell thank you. jim?\n\nthere are those in the savings and loan business crying foul over all of this deregulation. they claim they`ve been set up to be had by the big commercial banks. john hardin is one of those who think so. he`s president of the first federal savings and loan in rock hill, south carolina, and he`s the former president of his industry`s trade associ- ation, the u.s. league of savings associations. what are you upset about, mr. hardin?\n\nwell, we`ve been caught in quite a squeeze. you see, we`ve -- all of our loans in the past have been on a fixed rate, and now when the escalation of money has gone up so fast, mr. lehrer, we are not in a position to keep up with it as my friends in the commercial banking area. and we are supposed to be putting all of our -- most of our funds into mortgage loans. as a matter of fact, this country is a country of homeowners mainly because of savings and loans. we have made the bulk of the home loans for the last 150 years. this is the thing we want to continue to do. we want our business to be basically centered toward home ownership in this country.\n\nwhat will prevent you from doing that?\n\nwell, right now we`re paying, for instance, 15.6 percent for savings, on money market certificates, trying to be competitive, where our mortgage rate that we`re receiving is only 15 1/4, and of course this can`t go on. the high interest rates in the country -- and i`m delighted that senator garn is here, because he has been a great --\n\nhe`s the incoming chairman of the banking committee. we`re going to talk to him in a moment.\n\nyes indeed. and he`s done a great deal to help us and we`re looking forward to one specific thing, and that is, an incentive for savings for the people of this country, some type -- right now we have a $200 and a $400 tax-free savings. we -- he, i think, is in favor of $1,000 and $2,000, or something of that nature. this would be of tremendous effect.\n\nbut what about the savings and loan? i mean, under the -- where deregulation is going, everybody`s going to be free to compete.\n\nwell, i was interested in mr. loeb`s remark that the -- five years from now the differential would be done away with. it was done away with six weeks after the committee went into effect. they were supposed to have a six-year, gradual phase-out of the differential. and instead, in six weeks, their first meeting, they phased the entire thing out.\n\nbut not for passbooks, yet. they haven`t done that yet, have they?\n\nno, sir. this was where -- but where our bulk of our money is coming from right now. see, we are losing passbook money and it`s going into money market certificates, so the cost of our money is just escalating. and we really are not the ones that are getting hurt as much as the homebuilder and the electrician and the plumber and the painter and all of the millions of people in this country that are involved in homebuilding.\n\nbut also, under the deregulation law aren`t you free now to go out and compensate for this and get in the car loan business and open checking accounts?\n\nyes, sir. but let`s take the now accounts they were just talking about. this is really of no real help to us so far as improving our profit situation. it`ll be a service and we`re glad to offer it, but it will not be a real profitable service. now, we were given checking accounts, so to speak, or now accounts, but not commercial checking accounts. so in effect the savings and loans were given the loss leader, you see. and where the commercial banks really make money on checking accounts is in the commercial accounts. we don`t have that.\n\nwell, what do you think the impact of all of this is going to be on your industry?\n\nwell, in the first place most of our savings and loans are small, as i am -- 80 percent are under $100 million in assets. and they are having a difficult time adjusting to bringing out all these new services: now accounts, consumer loans, automobile loans. and we especially --\n\nyou mean, because you have to hire people and all that sort of thing?\n\nyes, sir. and learn specifically how to go about making these types of loans that the banks have been doing for years. you see, the commercial banks were set up in this country years ago to do a specific job, and they`ve done a wonderful job, and i want to congratulate them. they`ve kept the wheels of industry turning. we were set up 150 years ago to provide home ownership to the people of this nation. we have done it. i`m saying -- and we did it with that little tiny differential, you see.\n\none-quarter?\n\none-quarter, to attract money into savings and loans.\n\nbut somehow that --\n\nwell now, wait.\n\nyeah. okay.\n\nnow, if we did get the money with that little differential -- the commercial banks have prospered -- and i`m proud of them -- more than they ever have for the past ten years or so. we have done the same up until the last year. so if we`re both doing our job and doing it well, why rock the boat?\n\nbut the ceiling`s removed. and interest rates are going to go up -- in other words, the interest that can be paid to people. what in the world is a v4 of a percent going to do?\n\nwell, right now it`s kind of problematical. right now, under the present -- this is extreme times, with interest rates, the prime rate, centered at 20 percent. we`re talking about when we get back to something more normal than we`re living in now, because i don`t think that anybody agrees that we can continue in these types of interest-rate climate.\n\nbut it does make a difference, and you want it back?\n\nyes, sir.\n\nthank you. robin?\n\nnow the other side of the picture from the perspective of the commercial banks. sandra mcloughlin is senior vice president of pittsburgh`s mellon bank, the 16th largest bank in the country.\n\nms. mcloughlin has been active on committees of the american bankers association and in lobbying on banking issues. ms. mcloughlin, how do you and your bank feel about the new environment?\n\nwell, i think, robin, if you go back awhile in time, not only at the mellon bank but throughout the commercial banking industry, it`s entirely fair to say that the changes we`re seeing taking place now, effective january 1, have been in the making for a very long time. i think it`s entirely proper, and i think i speak for our industry -- i think it`s entirely proper that we begin to see a phasing out of reg q, and more attractive rates for the saver. like mr. hardin, we`re very concerned with the low propensity to save in this country. and it would seem that the savers need some market rate incentive. we believe that the phasing out of reg q will do that.\n\n\"reg q\" being?\n\nreg q being that regulation which controls the interest rates paid to savers.\n\nyeah. how do you think customers are going to benefit?\n\ni think customers will benefit -- i can only agree with mr. loeb`s earlier comments. by and large, while there are some problematic dimensions, perhaps, to the changes -- by and large i think it`s a good thing that customers have more choices, not fewer. it seems to me that the message to consumers in all of this is that -- is really twofold. one is that any sum of money, however small by relative standards -- any sum of money, if it`s yours, is worth shopping for. it`s worth shopping different financial institutions to find the best kind of use for your money, the best rate you can be paid for the money. that`s point one. and point two is that in fact the issues are becoming more complicated. along with the choices comes, of course, added complication. that means that consumers are going to probably have to pay a little closer attention to what their bank is giving them versus what the competition is giving them.\n\nwhat do you say to mr. hardin`s complaint that the deck`s been stacked against them -- the regulators have left you, the commercial banks, with the most profitable part of the business, which are corporate checking accounts and loans, and has given them very little?\n\nwell, i think the fact is that we have been competing for a very long time in the consumer lending arena, that the advent of commercial banking in the consumer arena is not new at all. i think it`s entirely appropriate. i believe i speak for our industry in this respect. it`s entirely appropriate that we now level the playing field. just as mr. hardin is -- has talked at some length about his unhappiness at eliminating the differential for all of the reasons that he might be unhappy, we see this as a plus not just for commercial banks but for the consumers, because at long last, once again the choices are expanded for the consumer.\n\nall right. i noticed in the wall street journal that a mr. w.c. smith, a realtor from your city, pittsburgh, said in an interview that the new law was an obituary for the savings and loans. do you regard it that way?\n\ni don`t regard it that way at all, robin. it seems to me that there is always room for any well-managed institution. i would have to agree with mr. hardin that probably the savings and loans have a greater adjustment to make at this juncture. on the other hand, i think we`ve all, including mr. hardin -- - i think we`ve seen this coming for awhile. so there has been some preparatory time. it`s not as though january 1, `81 we woke up on that morning and the banking laws were changed. this has been in the making for a good long time. all things considered, i think there are - - there is room for any well-managed institution, and that includes small savings and loans, just as it has for years included small commercial banks.\n\ndo you expect small banks and neighborhood banks to go out of business as a result of the new competitive wind?\n\ni don`t at all. and i think the proof of the pudding is the great diversity of size of commercial banking. if you start from the premise that savings and loans are now moving into an arena of very much broadened consumer banking powers -- if you start from that premise and now look at the small commercial banks across the country, who have been largely, for many years, in the consumer business, not in the corporate business, then you have to assume that just as small commercial banks have survived for many, many years, so, too, will the savings and loans survive. what i believe will happen, as has happened with small commercial banks, is that with increasing frequency we will see the smaller bank going to the larger bank for some automated support, and for some expertise that makes it possible -- buying those services, and making it thereby possible for the small bank to offer the broadest possible range of services to its marketplace.\n\nwell, thank you. jim?\n\nif congress is to make any new changes or adjustments in its deregulation of the financial business, it would most likely have to be done with the approval and support of senator jake garn, republican of utah. as of next monday, senator garn becomes chairman of the senate banking committee. senator, you`ve heard this discussion. what`s your view of how deregulation of the banking business is going so far?\n\njim, let me say i`ve heard this discussion for six long years of committee hearings, of testimony, of markups. this all did start even before that, many years before that. in 1975, the senate passed the financial institutions act, which was not passed by the house of representatives. and then each year the senate has passed similar legislation. the house has been reluctant. finally, in this year, through 1979 and into 1980, the house and the senate, after some long, long negotiations -- finally agreed to what you have referred to as the financial institutions deregulation act. it is a series of compromises. if i could write it it would be quite different. but obviously when you have a conference committee between the house and the senate there`s a great deal of give and take, and a lot of this came out late one night. overall, i agree with it. but there are nine sections of this bill. we`ve only discussed one or two. there are many other things, like mandatory reserves for all financial institutions now, rather than voluntary, the way i would have preferred. there`s simplification of truth-in-lending. so it`s a very complex thing. and i do think there will have to be some adjustments made in the future. i`ve said that all along: that once we came out with what appeared to be a level playing field, we would find out that it was not, and there were some advantages of some parts of the financial community, and disadvantages. i think congress is going to have to take a look at how it is working. and i do think we`ll be back with amendments in the future.\n\ndo you think the savings and loans people have a legitimate complaint, as mr. hardin outlined it?\n\nwhat i said just before we went on the air, that i thought all three segments of the financial community deserved what they got, because, although individuals, like mr. hardin, are saying exactly what they`ve said to me for years -- \"we don`t want to be a commercial bank; we don`t want now accounts; we don`t want these expanded authorities\" -- their associations and their lobbying groups have been saying otherwise. and their pressure has been very great, from the aba, from the u.s. savings and loan league, saying, \"we want to keep everything we have in the way of authority, but we want a piece of what this group is doing.\" and the credit unions wanted share drafts, and they wanted expanded authorities. i don`t mean to be unkind when i say they got what they deserve, but if they`d been content --\n\nbut that`s what they did, right?\n\nyeah. and they`ll say, \"well, hey, they shouldn`t get what they got, but we want what\" -- the typical -- \"our own ax is being ground, or ox is being gored.\" and so i think there are going to have to be some adjustments as a result of that. but the major problem of the savings and loan right now is not the deregulation bill. that is minor compared to the condition of this economy. and it is incredible, the cost of money -- and they are, a lot of them, in great trouble, because of 20 and 21 percent prime interest rates. if we could get the economy back under control, get congress under control, start balancing the budget and reducing federal expenditures, and get the economy in some sort of balance and level playing field, i don`t think the s&amp;ls and other small financial institutions are going to be in trouble, but they`re going to be dropping like flies unless we do our job.\n\nmr. hardin, though, is saying -- pretty much he`s saying that these savings and loans cannot compete against the commercial banks, and that, as he said, 80 percent of them are very small, and that this business of what is in the bill -- the now accounts and all of that -- - is going to cost them a lot of money and it`s going to be very difficult for them. many of them may go under.\n\nthat is why with regulation q being phased out, the interest rate differential, the quarter percent, at the expanded authorities to give flexibility for mortgage loans like commercial banks have had for years, to give them now accounts, and to give them other authorities, to compensate for the loss of that. i`m not sure yet, that that does fully compensate them for that. that`s one of the things we`re going to have to take a look at when we see how it works. but i think there`s a much bigger threat, whether it`s small banks or small savings and loans, and that is the big superbanks. and here we get into what we`re talking about, interstate branching. and i fear in the longer run seeing ten or twelve big banks in this country having thousands of branches all over the country. that is the real threat, in my opinion, to small savings and loans and small banks. and i don`t want that to happen. i think small --\n\nbut isn`t that the price you might have to pay for deregulation, to leave things to the open marketplace? sen. garn: well, now we`re talking about something different here than taking away interest rates.\n\nyou`re right, and i should never have asked that question. [laughter] let me give it to robin real fast. senator. thank you. robin?\n\nmr. hardin, the senator says that your industry, perhaps not you personally, got what you deserved and what your lobbying groups have been asking for.\n\nwell, there`s been a great difference of opinion on that. and actually the great bulk of our people have wanted to remain a savings and loan in our old standard of making home loans. now, i would like to clear up one thing, jim, that you said that -- someone said that maybe some of us would be going under and that type of thing. a number of our associations will have a difficult time and will not, say, make money this year. however, this -- we have adequate reserves, i want to be sure that everyone understands. we have the federal home loan bank, our system, that controls us, standing behind us, that has the opportunity to borrow from the treasury, to issue their own bonds. and we have the fslic that insures each account up to $100,000. so there`s really no alarm here about any of us going under. it`s a matter of, can we continue to attract enough profitable money in order to do the job that we were put here to do?\n\nmr. hardin, i heard mr. loeb agree vehemently when the senator said a minute ago that your real problem is with the state of the economy and not from this act at the moment.\n\ni agree with that. i agree with that a hundred percent, that it -- macneil: let`s give mr. loeb a chance to state it here.\n\ni think we have to stress, once again, that there is a major difference between deregulation and -- i find it very difficult in this economy, where everybody is complaining about the extreme regulation, to argue against deregulation. there is a difference between deregulation and the high rates. if the savings and loan associations, and the mortgage market in general, are in difficulty now, it is because of the incredibly high rates and the volatility of those rates, so that those institutions cannot plan ahead.\n\nwill that danger be passed if the rates go down soon?\n\nif the rates -- indeed, if the rates go down and stay at some reasonable level. we must question, of course, what is reasonable. is -- when some of us are carrying 5 and 6 percent mortgages from not so long ago, is a prime rate of 20 or 21 percent reasonable? is a prime rate of 12 percent reasonable? indeed, we absolutely have to get this economy stable and fight the inflation in order to bring down those rates.\n\nsenator garn, mr. hardin said they were going to fight to get that quarter percent, or whatever it is, differential back. !s there any likelihood of congress restoring the differential?\n\ni would not think so. certainly not in this particular year, unless some of their predictions do start to come true. but my own feeling is, is that the differential will be phased out, and, as i`ve said before, the most important thing we can do -- not only for savings and loan, but the consumers of this country -- is get the economy under control. and then i don`t think the quarter of a percent becomes nearly as important as what they are paying -- the cost of money now, with these tremendously high money market certificates. that`s where -- if you look at the statistics on the savings and loan, that`s where they`re losing their money for mortgages to, the transfer to the money market certificates, not because of the quarter percent eventually being phased out.\n\nms. mcloughlin, on a slightly different point that the senator also made, does your bank foresee all this leading inevitably to interstate branching and to a dozen or so big national banks with many branches?\n\ni think we very much see on the horizon some loosening, or some expansion, of branching laws. and i would presume the ultimate of that would be interstate branching. i don`t think we have ever seen that as meaning that the small bank will disappear. i think it will heighten the competition, and i think each time, classically and historically, when competition is heightened in any industry there are some who fall by the wayside because there are some who cannot compete. but i would not see the extension of branching laws or the easing of branching laws as being any more devastating in that regard -- any more devastating than any other kind of added competitive component. and in the final analysis i believe fervently that the added competition can only be good for the customers of the financial institutions.\n\nyou don`t see it quite that way, senator garn?\n\nwell, this is probably not a very good example. but, how many comer grocery stores do you see any more? and i guess the point can be made from competition from the giant supermarkets that the consumer has benefited, and i`m sure there are many benefits to that. but there`s also many lost benefits. at this point in time, i`m not willing to give up on some tremendous personal services given by small banks and savings and loan [and] credit unions in this country, to be dominated by ten or twelve huge superbanks in this country that i don`t think you`ll get the same service from.\n\ni have to leave it there, i`m afraid, senator garn. thank you. thank you, mr. hardin, ms. mcloughlin, for joining us. mr. loeb in new york. good night, jim.\n\ngood night, robin.\n\nthat`s all for tonight. we will be back tomorrow night. i`m robert macneil. good night.\n\n\n"
