              "@value": "\n\ngood evening, i'm gwen ifill, jim lehrer is off today. on the newshour tonight, ray suarez introduces us to three new faces for the proposed bush cabinet; we examine the already contentious fight over the nominee for attorney general; and elizabeth farnsworth takes us into the middle of the thorny dispute over palestinians who want to return to israel. it all follows our summary of the news this tuesday. \n\nnews summary\n\npresident-elect bush rounded out his cabinet today. he tapped a democrat, commerce secretary norman mineta, to head the transportation department. and he selected former reagan administration official, linda chavez for labor secretary and outgoing michigan senator spencer abraham as energy secretary. he said his nominees show the kind of leader he will be. \n\ni believe the american people want a president who seeks the best, people from all walks of life who are strong, experienced, capable americans. i'm going to work with every cabinet member to set a series of goals for each cabinet, for each area of our government, and i'll work with the cabinet secretaries to help achieve those goals. but i fully expect to get... i fully expect to be given straightforward talk, honest opinion, and i expect people to work for one thing in mind: that which is best for america. and i'm proud of this cabinet.\n\nwe'll have more about today's cabinet selections right after this news summary. palestinian leader arafat met with president clinton at the white house today. he wanted clarification of u.s. proposals for a middle east peace agreement. the proposal would grant palestinians partial control in east jerusalem. but palestinian refugees would give up their right to return to israel. white house spokesman jake siewert said the president hopes for progress before he leaves office in three weeks. \n\nthe time is of the essence here. we have a relatively narrow window of opportunity, but the president has promised to work up to the last day, and there's no reason why these negotiations-- if they commence-- could not be successful. but ultimately it's up to the parties to decide to sit down and to make the hard choices that are involved. \n\nin jerusalem, israeli prime minister barak said it was unlikely there would be any peace accord before the israeli elections in february. and the violence in the region continued today. in gaza, israeli troops killed a palestinian man and wounded seven. and roadside bombs wounded two israeli soldiers. there were significant lapses in u.s. security in the persian gulf before the attack on the u.s.s. \"cole.\" that's what a pentagon commission has concluded, according to reports today by major news organizations. they cite a communications breakdown between embassies and military commanders. the \"cole\" was ripped by a suicide bomb blast on october 12, in the port of aden, yemen. on wall street today, stocks dropped on continuing fears about lackluster corporate earnings. the dow jones industrial average lost 140 points to close at 10,646. the nasdaq index fell 178 points or about 7.2% to close at 2291. that's it for the news summary tonight, now it's on to the bush cabinet choices, and the ashcroft controversy, plus the palestinians' right of return to israel. \n\nfocus - new faces\n\nthree new faces for the president-elect's cabinet, one a democrat, and to ray suarez. \n\nthe three final cabinet appointments came late this afternoon at a press conference in austin. mr. bush's choice to head the energy department, michigan senator spencer abraham, lost his seat to democrat debbie stabenow last year. the one-term, 48-year-old senator is a fiscal conservative whose grandfathers were lebanese immigrants. abraham served in the previous bush administration as deputy chief of staff to vice president dan quayle. \n\nmany significant energy department-related issues face us at this time, ranging from the adequacy of supply to affordability, to the development of new technologies, to the issues of security at our facilities and more. fortunately, this administration is comprised of many individuals with incredible expertise in these areas, and i look forward to helping the president-elect to effectively address these challenges in the days ahead. \n\nlinda chavez, the president-elect's pick for labor secretary, is the second hispanic selected for a cabinet post. chavez is president of the center for equal opportunity, a conservative research organization in washington, dc. she served as white house director of public liaison and director of the u.s. commission on civil rights in the reagan administration. she ran for senate from maryland in 1986, but lost. today, chavez thanked her father, who was a house painter, and her mother, who worked in restaurants and department stores. \n\nif i am confirmed as secretary of labor, i intend to keep faith with the men and the women who still work at jobs like those my parents held. i hope also to seek out new opportunities to increase the skills and the productivity of all americans, to promote safe working conditions, and to administer the nation's labor laws. i intend to vigorously enforce the department's regulations to guarantee nondiscrimination by federal contractors. and i want to work with employers to ensure that the department of labor assists the private sector in expanding economic opportunity and job growth. \n\nin naming current commerce secretary norman mineta to be transportation secretary, president-elect bush fulfilled a promise to name a democrat to his cabinet. president clinton tapped the 69- year-old mineta to be secretary of commerce last summer. mineta was a senior vice president of transportation systems and services at lockheed martin. he served as a democratic congressman from california for 20 years, chairing the house committee on public works and transportation and the aviation subcommittee. mineta was also the mayor of san jose. \n\nover the last year, this country has witnessed a very hard-fought election, and i was proud to stand with my party. i have been honored to serve in president clinton's cabinet as secretary of commerce. i am a democrat-- with both a small \"d\" and a large one-- and i am proud of and committed to my party's principles and its heritage. however, the campaign is over, and under our constitutional system, a decision has been rendered. and we are now in the essential transition period when we move from campaigning to governance. as you have said time and time again, mr. president-elect, the challenge before all of us as americans, regardless of party affiliation, is to find those areas where we can build bipartisan consensus on the policies and the programs that are needed to move this nation forward. i believe that there is no more fertile ground for building a bipartisan consensus on what is necessary and right for our country than in the area of transportation policy. there are no democratic or republican highways, no such thing as republican or democratic traffic congestion, no such thing as republican or democratic aviation and highway safety. cargo is not shipped by republican or democratic railroad ships, barges, or pipelines. our national transportation policy must have one overriding bipartisan goal, and that is to give our economy the tools and the infrastructure it needs in order to create and sustain growth and prosperity. \n\nafter announcing his cabinet appointments, mr. bush took questions on a variety of topics this afternoon including energy policy. \n\nmr. president-elect, opec plans to cut oil production by a million and a half barrels on january 17. are you concerned this will affect the current heating oil situation or raise gas prices in the future? and would you consider raising the issue with the saudis or other opec members before that january 17 meeting? \n\nno, the nation needs to speak with one voice. we have one president. but the fact that opec is thinking about reducing the world supply of crude oil and thereby affecting the price at the pump and the price of heating oil indicates the need for us to have an energy policy that makes us less dependent on foreign sources of crude. the ideal world is one in which we don't have to worry about somebody reducing supplies on the world markets. we've got a long way to go from there. but we need to be exploring, in an environmentally sensitive way, for oil and gas here at home. secondly, a cornerstone of our diplomatic efforts will be to work with our friends in the middle east, particularly as it relates to matters of energy. but know the president of the united states will be the president until january 20, and our nation will speak with one voice. \n\nmr. president-elect, can you about why you feel it's important to have a democrat in your cabinet besides the qualifications of mr. mineta -- the symbolism you think it might bring. \n\nyou bet. first i don't want to speak over the qualifications. this man is perfectly suited for the job. he made a career in the halls of congress focusing on transportation issues with a philosophy that we share. and i can't wait for people in our party to hear norm talk about his vision for transportation. but it's also important to send a signal that this is an administration that recognizes talent when we see it regardless of political party. and this is an extraordinarily talented american. i love his story. i'm so honored that he agreed to join the administration, and he's going to make a great addition. i wish everybody a continued happy new year. i look forward to seeing you at the next availability. \n\nand now, how this is playing on capitol hill? we're joined by two senate leaders, republican don nickles of oklahoma, the assistant majority leader, and democrat harry reid of nevada, the minority whip.\n\nsenator nickles, maybe we could start with you. you heard the president-elect talk about the significance of appointing a democrat to the cabinet. it came in the last series of appointments, something he said he wanted to do. as a member of the senate, what do you see as the significance? \n\nwell, i like president-elect bush doing what he said he's going to do. i compliment him on his choice. i've known norm mineta, i served with him when he was in the house. he has a lot of respect. he did a good job over at commerce for president clinton. and i think he'll do a very good as secretary of transportation for president bush. \n\nsenator reid, same question. what do you see as the significance of the appointment of a democrat to the cabinet? \n\ni think it's very important. i think secretary cohen has been an outstanding person for america. he certainly hasn't hurt his republican credentials. i think norm mineta will be a good democrat and do a great job with transportation. frankly, i don't know of anyone in america that could have been chosen that knows more about transportation than norm mineta. he served on a very large infrastructure committee in the house, has 45 or 50 members. maybe they've raised it to 60 now. it's a huge committee. he's done the bill with us every five years, the very important transportation bill. he's worked in the private sector. i just think he will be a great secretary of transportation. \n\nis there a... while there's a similarity in the numbers, a quantitative parity, is there a qualitative difference between the portfolios? was it a more significant thing to make a bill cohen secretary of defense one of the top jobs in the cabinet as opposed to making a democrat secretary of transportation? \n\ni felt all along that we should have some parity, that it would have been nice to have a secretary of state, secretary of defense, maybe an attorney general, but, you know, we got what we got andnorm mineta is a qualified guy and the president-elect has a right to pick anyone he wants. we'll have to take each of them at face value, have some hearings and see how things go. i don't want the fact that mineta wasn't chosen for secretary of defense or one of the bigger positions to take away from his qualifications. he is going to be real good. \n\nsenator nickles, is it an apples-to-apples comparison when you take a look at the two departments and their prestige within the cabinet?\n\nwell, i just think you look at the appointments that president-elect bush has made, i think they're outstanding. if you look at the top positions, colin powell, don rumsfeld, paul o'neill, those are outstanding people. norm mineta, as my colleague senator reid said, he's exceptionally well qualified for secretary of transportation. so he's got an all-star cabinet. i think he did a fantastic job putting the cabinet together. and i compliment him for doing it so quickly. that was more difficult than one would anticipate because the election took so long, but i think he's got a great cabinet and i think they'll they will be a real credit to america, and my compliments to the president for putting together so quickly. \n\nwell, you mentioned that the election took so long. in fact, the bush process of appointing the cabinet was shorter than a lot of modern presidents. he did it rather quickly, and now that we've seen the shape of the complete proposed cabinet, what do you think it says about how the president- elect intends to govern? \n\nwell, i think it speaks very well for him. i think it's a cabinet of almost unequaled stature from the top positions all the way down. these are people who are enormously well qualified who can do a fantastic job, who have a great deal of credibility, leadership, stature already on their own. so, these aren't individuals that are going to need on-the-job training, that are going to be overwhelmed by bureaucracy or... and that could easily happen. all these cabinet-level positions, they all have thousands of employees. they're enormously complex. i think he's got some great people who will, you know, grab the challenge and work with congress. most all of them are professionals in the fact that they've managed businesses or they've had enough experience either in the pentagon or in congress that i think they'll work with congress-- democrats and republicans-- to get some positive accomplishments for our country. \n\nbut, senator nickles, when you look at their backgrounds, when you look at the ideological strands of the party that they represent, does this proposed cabinet reflect the closeness of the election, the closeness of the national legislature? \n\nwell, i just think it's an outstanding cabinet with very good, qualified people. again, whether you're talking about don rumsfeld or you're talking about paul o'neill or john ashcroft, several of these people, these are outstanding people who are enormously well qualified who, i think, will do a fantastic job for our country. \n\nsenator reid, you wanted to say? \n\nray, i think that we have to realize that these people haven't yet been confirmed by the senate. i accept every one of them at face value. i think we have to say the president-elect has a right to choose anyone he wants and he's done that. but now we go into the hearing process. and i think, generally speaking, these people are going to be confirmed but we know that there are things that are going to come up during the hearings as, i think, linda chavez, that's going to be an interesting hearing. i think we're going to find out what she written about... you know, anyone that has written a lot, we have to say, have they in effect bork-ed themselves, that is, going back to the bork supreme court nomination he'd written so much that he wound up trapping himself. we'll have to see what she has written. we'll have to see what she's said. we have to look at the secretary of interior very closely, gale norton, to find out if her close association with secretary watt has been something that disqualifies her. at this stage i know nothing. i think we have to look at our former colleague, john ashcroft, who i think he's a very fine man. but there are people who need to look at what he said to find out what his involvement was with the ronnie white episode, to find out if he's willing to enforce the laws as it relates to clinic violence and other things. at this stage -- i repeat -- at face value they're all fine, good people, but the hearing process develops and goes off on tangents, we've learned during the past 25 years, that develop different scenarios. we'll have to wait and see. i do say this in support of my counterpart on the republican side: i really think that president-elect bush has done a good job in getting these people to us very quickly. in years past, we've waited and waited and waited for these nominations to come to us. we, the senate, have no problem now. we can't blame it on bush that we're not doing these hearings hurriedly, that he's holding us up. it's up to us to get a government in place as quickly as we can. \n\nwell, senator nickles, you just heard maybe not the democratic party's playbook but a couple names have come up that may bring some added scrutiny. are you concerned about one or another of the various designates having a rough time when it comes time for hearings? \n\nno, i don't, ray. i will just guess that all of his nominees will be confirmed by overwhelming votes. that doesn't mean we won't have some serious questions before the confirmation process. usually you hear people say, oh, they're really going after john ashcroft. i know john ashcroft. i think most of our colleagues know him. he's an outstanding senator, former governor, former attorney general. you couldn't be more qualified for the position of attorney general. he had eight years as attorney general in missouri, graduated from distinguished law schools and was an outstanding senator, happened to serve on the judiciary committee. i think he's eminently qualified. i think he will be confirmed with the rest and gale norton, i happen to have known her. she was a candidate for the senate a few years ago. she will do a very good job as secretary. so, anyway, i'm confident that president-elect bush has made some great nominations and they'll stand up to the scrutiny of the confirmation process. one of the things i hope that we'll do is make sure we don't go into the bork process and \"bork\" somebody. i hope that we don't try to crucify somebody because they happen to be nominated for a cabinet- level position. we need to review their records; we need to find out where they stand on issues, but my guess is that the senate is going to start conducting itself a little more appropriately, maybe the way we did several years ago, where most nominees will be confirmed in pretty short order. \n\nwell, during this small window of time between the naming of the cabinet members and the beginning of the confirmation process, is the fax machine in your office warm to the touch? is the phone ringing off the hook? what happens about now for sitting senators? \n\nwell, i'll let my colleague answer right now. there's always intense scrutiny on anything they've ever said or written. my friend, senator reid, said something about linda chavez. she's been on tv; she's written a lot. and so i'm sure they'll find some ammo and maybe some people will try and destroy her record. but i know her well, and she'll be an outstanding secretary of labor and i'm sure she'll be confirmed as well. but anything they've ever written, ever said, will be used either for them or against them, but again with this caliber of nominations, i think they'll all get through. \n\nsenator reid, are you starting to hear from advocacy groups on one side or another? \n\nof course. but the one thing i want to elaborate on what don has said: you know, this nomination process is very difficult. filling out the forms is very difficult, not only for cabinet officers but sub cabinet and people within the white house and other offices that make up this federal government. we've got to make it easier to get people to want these jobs. that's one of the difficult things. so i would hope that when we go through the confirmation process with these cabinet officers, we are thorough but we want to be fair. i think we need to do that. we have to make people want these jobs. what has developed over the last 20 years in washington is we're having trouble getting people to take these jobs because of the brutality of the process itself. and so i would hope we can join together as democrats and republicans to make the process more civil. \n\nsenator reid, senator nickles, thank you both for joining us. \n\nstill to come on the newshour tonight, the ashcroft controversy, and the palestinian right of return debate. \n\nfocus - confirmation conflict\n\nnow, more on that brewing conflict over the nominee for attorney general. on the day he was nominated for attorney general, john ashcroft said his only intent is to uphold the law. \n\nquite simply, we will strive to be a guardian of liberty and equal justice. for freedom, as president-elect bush has noted, can flourish only in a culture defined by the rule of law, a rule of law that knows no class, that sees no color and bows to no creed. \n\nashcroft became available for the justice job in a highly unusual manner. he was defeated for reelection to the senate by the late missouri governor mel carnahan, who was killed in a plane crash during the campaign. carnahan's widow, jean, was appointed to take his place. \n\n(november 8, 2000) missouri is a compassionate state, and i think in a very special way they have demonstrated the compassion which they have. and i hope that the outcome of this election is a matter of comfort to mrs. carnahan. \n\nashcroft, 58, served two terms as governor of missouri and one term in the senate. last year, he contemplated-- and then decide against-- running for president. two lightning rod issues have clouded ashcroft's nomination: abortion and race. ashcroft opposes all abortion, including exceptions for rape and incest. and he has argued that ronnie white, a missouri supreme court justice nominated by president clinton to the federal bench, is soft on crime. today, the president-elect defended his nominee. \n\nyou've taken great pains to diversify your cabinet, but are you concerned that with the nomination of senator ashcroft and specifically the battle that is brewing coming from civil rights groups and others-- that that will undercut that accomplishment in any way? \n\nfirst of all, david, i would hope that all our nominations sail through, but that's not generally the way it goes. i am sure there is going to be some tough questioning for some of our nominees. but they're all fully prepared to handle the tough questioning. and i hope people do talk to john ashcroft about his vision of civil rights and his concept of fairness in america -- because i certainly did. i want to remind you all that this is a man who became the attorney general of the state of missouri -- was elected as the governor of the state of missouri -- and a united states senator in the state of missouri; a man who had a record of taking his heart and philosophy to the people of a swing state and got elected. and i'm confident he will withstand the scrutiny about his fairness and his heart. unfortunately, sometimes politics enters into the confirmation process. i understand that and so does he, but i'm confident that when it is all said and done senator ashcroft will be confirmed by the senate. \n\nas the debate over the ashcroft nomination heats up, we turn to four of the combatants. kate michelman is the president of naral, the national abortion and reproductive rights action league, elaine jones is the director of the naacp legal defense fund, clint bolick is the litigation director at the institute for justice, and ken conner is president of the family research council. \n\nelaine jones, from a legal point of view looking at john ashcroft as potential for the being the nation's top lawyer, what is wrong or right with this nomination? \n\nyou know, gwen, i wish i did not have to be here opposing this nomination; but when you look at john ashcroft and his views overall, what you get is a sense of a throw- back to the '50s in terms of our civil rights laws. they didn't exist. in the last 35 years as a nation, we have gone through fits and starts, up and down, creating this scheme of civil rights protections for all of us, and now in comes john ashcroft opposing hate crimes, you know, looking... very differently looking at the whole question of employment discrimination -- looking at the whole issue of representation on the bench, on a diverse federal bench. i mean, and so it just gives you a real sense that we are in some very serious jeopardy of holding on to that fabric that we as a nation have fought to establish. \n\nclint bolick, elaine jones speaks in apocalyptic terms about this nomination. \n\nin extreme and excessive terms. john ashcroft is a man who believes to the core of his soul in the civil rights laws of this country. he signed the first hate crimes legislation in missouri history. he voted for 26 out of 28 minority appointments of president clinton to the bench. the two he voted against-- one, ronnie white, was opposed by 55 members of the united states senate, including such moderates as jim jeffords and arlen specter. the other was withdrawn by president clinton. he signed into law the martin luther king birthday holiday in missouri, which was contentious elsewhere. this is a man who will restore integrity to the justice department, which desperately needs that integrity. what elaine jones doesn't like is that times have changed and that a majority of americans think that the era of racial division ought to be over; so too does john ashcroft. \n\nken conner, the other big issue, of course, is abortion. as you know, of course, john ashcroft is very much anti-abortion. is this something that you... is it a relief to see him nominated from your point of view? \n\nfor those of us who cherish life and believe that it's immoral and legally wrong to extinguish the lives of innocent children, we are heartened by the nomination of senator ashcroft. he is a man committed to the rule of law. i expect that he will enforce the law and bring much needed confidence back to the justice department which has been grossly over politicized during the clinton administration. he's a person of goodwill, which is not to be confused with a lack of will. and i think it's very heartening to people around the country who cherish life that a person such as senator ashcroft, a distinguished lawyer, a distinguished statesman, has been nominated for this position. \n\nwhen you say rule of law, does that also extend in your opinion to upholding roe versus wade? \n\ni think it extends to upholding the laws that are on the books. i think it extends to affirming the decisions that are in place, recognizing that many of us have believe that in roe versus wade the supreme court of the united states hijacked the constitution and wrote law, made law from the bench rather than followed the law. we would certainly hope that senator ashcroft, in his new position, would recommend judges who would be committed to interpreting the law and who would leave lawmaking to the lawmakers. \n\nkate michelman, is john ashcroft a threat to abortion rights? \n\nno question. president-elect bush couldn't have chosen anyone, not anyone, more hostile to a woman's right to choose than john ashcroft. he has spent his entire public career as governor, as attorney general, as senator assaulting a woman's right to choose, trying to undo roe versus wade. i've heard a lot of discussion about his qualifications and upholding the rule of law. roe versus wade recognized a woman's constitutional right to privacy and reproductive freedom and choice. roe versus wade stands as a monument to women's equality. in fact, justice blackman, who wrote roe, said over and over again roe was necessary as women continued their long journey to full emancipation. it was right in 1973 and it's right in 1994 when he said that and it's right in 2001. john ashcroft has done everything in his power, in all of his public offices to take that right away. in fact, he supports legislation that would define life beginning at fertilization, which would not only criminalize all abortions, take away a woman's right to reproductive freedom and choice but would also outlaw and criminalize many forms of the most common birth control options. this is a serious opponent of women's constitutional and fundamental rights of choice. yes, he's qualified. he's qualified as the leader of those who want to dismantle roe versus wade and take women back to a day when they had no control over their lives and, in fact, when their lives and health were endangered. \n\nclint bolick --\n\ni think it might be important to remember that the dred scott decision was once the law of the land. plessy versus ferguson was once the law of the land, but that didn't mean the law wasn't capable of evolution to come up with a better sense of what was fair and just. i believe you can expect senator ashcroft to enforce the rule of law and to work through the appropriate processes to encourage a change in the law to yield a fair and just result for innocent unborn children. \n\nwhat we're being told clearly is that you're talking about activists. what we are going to have from an attorney general-elect ashcroft is a wholesale assault on existing civil rights principles. that is as clear as a bell. now, senator ashcroft is reported to have said-- and i don't know whether i have to double check this-- he's reported to have said at one time-- i don't know whether he was in jest or not-- saying that the only things in the middle of the road are a moderate and a dead skunk. i said, well, there's something else in the middle road. and something else in the middle of the road is a white line down the middle of the road. and the people of the united states expect the attorney general to be right there on that line. \n\njust one moment. clint bolick just said, he talked about the fact that ronnie white had been opposed by many people -- ronnie white, the african- american jurist in missouri. what's your response to that? \n\ni did not raise the issue of the federal judicial appointments. that is a frightening thing when you look at the whole question of the attorney general of the united states and the department of justice as a gatekeeper to the federal bench. that's what it is. it's where judges come in for their questioning. it's where the selection begins. ronnie white was the first african-american jurist on the supreme court of missouri, well regarded, well respected. the senate judiciary committee voted him out overwhelmingly. and 17 months later here comes senator ashcroft ambushing the man arguing that the man was soft on crime and pro death penalty when the facts are that of the 59 death penalty cases that this judge ronnie white had, 41 of them he affirmed. i mean it was an ambush. and clint talks about the 55 senators. senator ashcroft went to the republican caucus and for his own political partisan purposes he persuaded the republican caucus to vote against ronnie white on purely a partisan political.... \n\nelaine just said something that i really love about john ashcroft, and that makes him almost unique here in washington and that is he is a guy who fights for what he believes in. when john ashcroft gives you his word, he is going to keep his word. i think that's the sort of thing that we need more of in washington and certainly need in an attorney general. but what elaine just does not like is that the law of the land is not where she wants it to be. the law of the land is that racial discrimination is wrong, regardless of whether it's called benign or.... \n\nwhat was racially discriminatory in the ronnie white selection?\n\nthere was not discriminatory in that selection. john ashcroft as governor appointed the first african-american judge to the western district court of appeals. as i said he voted for the vast majority of minority nominees. this is race-baiting pure and simple. it is an effort on the part of the left wing and the democratic party to inflame the base by injecting race. ashcroft opposed a lot of nominees because he disagreed with them fundamentally on their view of the law not because of their race. \n\nken conner, among the other things john ashcroft opposed as senator was his notion of buffer zones around abortion clinics or at least a buffer zone which would allow protesters to have a maintain a certain amount of distance. do you imagine as attorney general he would be able to affect that, would be able to repeal that, would have some effect? would you want him to? \n\ni expect that he would enforce the existing law, and we would hope that he would work to change the existing law. certainly, i think there are many, many people around the country, many first amendment scholars included who believe that the buffer zone requirements represent an abridgement of free speech. and so i expect in senator ashcroft that you'll find a man who committed to the rule of law will work to enforce the existing law and at the same time where the administration disagrees with the law as it currently exists to follow the proper processes to build the public and legislative consensus to pass laws that more nearly equate with what's fair and just. \n\nhow much pressure are you prepared to put on the justice department to change those laws? \n\nwell, we certainly intend to lobby the administration and the congress, the administrative changes, to change laws that we think are unfair and unjust. we believe it to be wrong that innocent children are killed in this country to the tune of about a million 400,000 every year. we think that's a grave wrong in this country. and we look forward to judges who will interpret the law, who will interpret the constitution, and not use the bench as a vehicle for advancing their own political or personal or philosophical agendas. we believe that judges who strictly construe the constitution in accordance with the intent of the founders will do away ultimately in the final analysis with this law called roe versus wade, which has resulted in extermination of 42 million children since it was first passed by the supreme court of the united states. \n\nkate michelman, are you gearing up for a big fight on this? \n\nabsolutely. the future of a woman's right to choose, the future of a woman's equality is on the line here. president-elect bush, i must admit i was a bit startled by the nomination in this respect. he campaigned hard to convince people who were pro-choice, especially pro-choice women, that he was moderate on these issues. and in one bold, dramatic fail swoop he sort of cracked his facade and showed his intent to do away with a woman's right to choose by putting in place one of the most hostile to women's rights, people he could find to lead the justice department. i want to go back to something elaine said. this attorney general role has a prominent position in the cabinet as a whole. it is influential in domestic policy as a whole -- vets the supreme court justice nominations, other federal nominations; advises the president on federal legislation, advises the president in numerous ways. this nomination poses an enormous threats to rights that women took a century to gain. and i think it's a harbinger of things to come in terms of the kinds of appointments that george bush is going to make to satisfy those hard-liners who helped him get elected, helped bring votes to him. and i might add that the president- elect has no mandate to take away a woman's right to choose. people who voted... more people voted for a pro-choice candidate than for an anti-choice candidate. so with this nomination i think the president has laid the gauntlet down. i think that john ashcroft can be counted on to not necessarily enforce the law but to try to undo the law that protects a woman's fundamental right to choose. \n\nelaine jones. \n\nand clint bolick just made the point that john ashcroft believes in the point and will drive it home. i say yes to the point of inflexibility. he has a belief. \n\nbut it's a republican president that is making republican appointments. \n\nyes. yes.\n\nwhat can you do to stop that?\n\nand a republican president has every right to make a conservative appointment. a democratic president can make a conservative appointment. that is why i am saying that john ashcroft is outside of that mold. it is much too far, he's not in the middle of the road. he's not a little bit over to the right. he defines on this issue one who has made up his mind on, you know, there's a right way to go on these issues and all of our laws that we have carefully put together for the past 35 years can be up for grabs. \n\na response, clint bolick. \n\nmy fondest hope is that you will spend a tremendous amount of capital and energy on this because at the end of the day john ashcroft will be confirmed. there's no surprise that governor bush has chosen john ashcroft as his attorney general. governor bush was a law-and-order governor in texas. he believes in the role of law, so too does john ashcroft. i said that he keeps his promises. the most sacred promise that he will make is his oath to uphold the law of the land, when he's sworn in as attorney general. unlike the last eight years i think we'll have an attorney general who will actually do that. \n\nas clint does, i say the u.s. senate will hear us and they will vote on the basis of what they hear. \n\nwell, as ray suarez says, i can tell that the fax machines are heating up. thank you all very much. \n\nsecond look - unsettled lives\n\na second look now at a story we aired after last summer's middle east peace negotiations at camp david. in august, elizabeth farnsworth traveled to israel, the west bank and gaza to look at some of the key issues. here is her report on the debate over the right of return for palestinian refugees, an increasingly contentious negotiating point in the latest middle east peace talks. \n\n\n\nthese are the faces of palestinian refugees whose fate is at stake in peace negotiations underway now. rasslan sukkar fled jaffa in what is now israel in 1948 when he was 12 years old. his wife left jaffa as a child too. they, their children, and grandchildren -- three generations -- have lived most of their lives in a refugee camp in gaza. they live in this house in the 'beach camp,' as it is called. it is a small city now, with more than 75,000 people. the united nations has helped refugees construct houses here, building up, not out, because of limited space. this is one of the most densely populated areas on earth -- and one of the poorest. the annual per capita income here is $800. thirty-four sukkars live in this three-story house. they all say the main thing they want from peace negotiations is simply to go back home to jaffa. and that is a desire israeli negotiators resolutely oppose. the places refugees like the sukkars consider home, are mostly inhabited by jewish israelis now, many of them refugees from europe and the middle east. yuli tamir is a member of the cabinet of prime minister ehud barak:\n\ncan you imagine now a jewish move back to europe, saying to people in poland, or in germany or in czechoslovakia, go back, leave your houses -- those were our houses?\n\nin gaza, the sukkar family gathered to explain their desire to go home.\n\n(speaking through interpreter) we are determined....if it's not us, it's the sonsof our sons -- one day they will go back.\n\nrasslan sukkar's father was a manager of stevedores at the jaffa harbor until 1948 when the family fled the chaos of the war that followed the declaration of the jewish state in palestine. \n\n(speaking through interpreter) in 1948 because of the war, we had to leave there and emigrate through egypt; and after two years there we had to come and live in gaza. the un was the only organization helping; otherwise a lot of people would have been dead by now.\n\n(speaking through interpreter) i remember when i left jaffa i was even years old. my father was always telling us tomorrow, next month, next year, and until now look what happened to us.... we didn't go nowhere.\n\nyou still have your key?\n\n(speaking through interpreter) i remember my aunt at that time, my husband's mother, when we were leaving, she locked the door and put it around her neck.\n\n(speaking through interpreter) when i look at this key, i say where am i from? fifty years i'm waiting to go back to my palestinian soil in jaffa. \n\njaffa, which is just south of tel aviv, lies tantalizingly close to the sukkars' gaza home -- a 40 mile drive up the mediterranean coast. the family has returned to jaffa occasionally, but they need a special permit from the israelis to cross the border, and it is often refused. \n\nstanding here next to the ancient port of jaffa , it's easy to understand why refugees like the sukkars want so intensely to return. they remember this beautiful light, the graceful homes, the fragrance of orchards that used to surround the city. even palestinians who didn't flee, who are still here, remember the old times with longing. one of those palestinians is fakhri geday, a pharmacist who is writing a history of the arabs community here. on a tour, geday described what jaffa was like before the 1948 fighting drove people like the sukkars out. the city was mainly arab, he said, but with many jews. of more than 65,000 arabs in 1948; all but a few thousand fled. today, jaffa is part of tel aviv now and is mostly jewish-israeli. geday said 75% of the old arab buildings in jaffa, including the sukkars' home, have been destroyed. those that remain are much in demand now, and some are being restored.\n\nthis building used to be an arab building. it was bought by a jewish lawyer, who is my friend, sewkawalski. and he repaired it and is now renting it.\n\nisraeli artist etti barchil has been a leader in the effort to protect the old arab homes. she and her husband restored this 150-year-old house themselves. her family fled anti-jewish persecution in iran in 1949. she has little sympathy for the palestinian refugees' desire to return.\n\n(speaking through interpreter) the truth is i cannot blame people who fled out of fear, i cannot judge them, but the fact is that a lot of people stayed. over a million people in israel today are palestinian arabs who chose to stay. i have no problem with that. but we were forced to flee, and that's important to emphasize. we've got a small piece of land. damn it, let us live!\n\ngaby aldor also lives in a restored arab home. she bought it from the israeli housing authority, which took over abandoned arab properties after 1948. some of aldor's family came from europe in the early 20th century, some later, fleeing the holocaust. she's a choreographer/director who has produced a much-awarded theaterpiece about the overlapping claims in this city.\n\nhow do you justify living in a home that, that perhaps belongs to somebody else?\n\nwell, it's the same as i can't justify or not justify the fact that somebody's living in my father's house in vienna. i mean this is really the tragedy of history. in this century people have been moved, people move. so what i can do is recognize their pain and say yes, it is painful... you can't emotionally say \"o.k. palestinians, something was done wrong to them...because you can't cut it off from the history of the whole era; and the whole era's history is awful.\n\nin aldor's play, the protagonist, like the sukkars, long to go home.\n\nin my play, the guy has a key, but as a matter of fact, no one can come back because there is no way back . so i understand his longing. but my father was longing, all his life, for vienna. there is no way back, ever. o.k. i say \"you're welcome. come here.\" where do i go? vienna? i'm not wanted there.\n\ngaby aldor said this issue is especially sensitive because israelis in jaffa and elsewhere worry a palestinian right of return threatens israel's existence as a jewish state. cabinet minister tamir explained. \n\nfor us, the main motivation of the peace process, apart from living in peace with our neighbors, is that we would like to have a state which is a jewish state, that has mainly a jewish majority. and at the moment i don't think that the middle east is ripe for some sort of mingling of populations and if the refugees will come back to the territory of israel, israel will turn into a binational state.\n\nwell, see that's part of the process of negotiations where you try to intimidate the other side by making justice so catastrophic to your side it's unthinkable.\n\nsalim tamari is a palestinian sociologist who has been closely involved in negotiations on the refugee issue. he has pushed for the right of return as an essential component of a just peace. his old home in jaffa has become a drug rehabilitation center. he would like it returned to his family, at least in principal; but says they probably wouldn't go back.\n\nthe right of return does not mean the practice of the right of return by four and a half million refugees. it means the refugees have the principle right to return as a choice and then the modalities of return will have to be negotiated with the israelis.\n\nin this respect i think the same advice i'm giving the palestinians, i'm also giving our own people: you cannot turn the historical will backwards, and if you do, it will just cause disaster. imagine if all the jewish refugees who came here from the arab world would now say, \"okay, we want to go back to morocco or tunisia or algeria or to syria, or to egypt. i think this would destabilize the area to an enormous extent.\n\nwhile experts and negotiators debate, researchers at the \"orient house,\" the headquarters of the palestinian leadership in e. jerusalem, are working to document arab holdings confiscated by israelis since 1948. using records going back to the ottoman empire and the years when the british ruled, geographers are painstakingly identifying ownership of arab homes and lands then and now.\n\nin the past palestinian negotiators had resisted discussing compensation; but it is very much on the table now, tamari says.\n\ncompensation is being considered now as part of a package which includes the right ofreturn, repatriation, resettlement and restitution. now compensation is acceptable only within this context because it will have to include, for example, notions of restitution, which means people who had property, at least some of them, will be able to claim their property back.\n\nthe israelis have their own proposals too...\n\nfirst of all israel insists it will not recognize the right of return to the sovereign territory of the state of israel; however we are trying to put together a package deal that will alleviate the pain and suffering of the palestinian refugees. we will also take into account that israel itself has absorbed many jewish refugees from the arab world, from all around the world, and we'll try to work for the benefit of those individuals.\n\nspecifically, there was discussion at camp david about setting up an international consortium which would administer a multibillion dollar fund to provide compensation to palestinians refugees and perhaps to jewish refugees from arab countries too. the money would come from the united states, europe and other countries. no one can say at this point what a peace agreement might mean for the sukkar family in gaza. they have heard they may be offered compensation instead of the right of return, but they know nothing is definite. \n\n(speaking through interpreter) if they want to give me compensation, look, i mean, to give me back my life is cheaper than to give me money; i my land. i want my land. to give me compensation my suffering -- my suffering is in the heart; it will not go away.\n\nsince that report was prepared, renewed violence in gaza, the west bank and in israel has cost more than 300 lives, mostly palestinian. \n\nrecap\n\nagain, the major stories of this tuesday, president-elect bush rounded out his cabinet with nominees for transportation, labor and energy. and palestinian leader arafat met with president clinton at the white house. they discussed the latest u.s. proposals for a middle east peace settlement. we'll see you online, and again here tomorrow evening. i'm gwen ifill, thank you and good night.\n"
